# HTTP SERVER

An HTTP Server written in C. Just a fun little project. I want to make a polished server which implements as much of the HTTP/1.1 specification as possible. Also a way to learn about CMake, Docker, and how real life programs work.

Currently I am only working on the server component and I'll add the other ones after.
